<h1>What is Cipher Text or Char?</h1>
<p>In the world of cryptography, cipher is an algorithm or procedure or steps neeeded to encrypt or decrypt a text, sentence or word.
    Generally speaking, it is an approach to hide or unhide a single letter or char (character) for the purpose of information security,
      data security in the world of computer science and information technology.</p>

  <h2>Description</h2>
  <h3>Cipher-Encryption</h3>
  <p>Let's say that you want to convey a secret message to someone which you really don't like to tell anybody else in the classroom
     except that person.So how can you actually convey the message so that it can only be readable to that person and nobody else?
     Well here comes the term cipher, which exactly does the same as you were thinking about.But <b>HOW?</b>

 <br>
 <br>
Let's say that your secret message contains a word <i>Hello</i>.So what cipher does is that it actually iterates (go by) over each letter
    or char and adds a key to it (let's say key = 1) so <i>H</i> becomes <i>I</i>, <i>e</i> becomes <i>f</i>, <i>l</i> becomes <i>m</i>,
    <i>o</i> becomes <i>p</i>, so it really translates the word from <i>Hello</i> to <i>Ifmmp</i>.Sounds really hard nah? so that
    no one could guess that you are saying <i>Hello</i> to someone rather they think that you are saying <i>Ifmmp</i> which really
    doesn't makes any sense right? This is called <b>Cipher Encryption</b></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>So this exactly how cipher works for encrypting or decrypting a text, sentence or word.</p>
